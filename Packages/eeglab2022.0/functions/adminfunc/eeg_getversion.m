% eeg_getversion() - obtain EEGLAB version number (version is embedded in
%                    the script, edit the function to see the version).
%
% Usage:
%     >> vers = eeg_getversion;
%     >> [vers vnum] = eeg_getversion;
%
% Outputs:
%    vers = [string] EEGLAB version number
%    vnum = [float] numerical value for the version. For example 11.3.2.4b
%           is converted to 11.324
