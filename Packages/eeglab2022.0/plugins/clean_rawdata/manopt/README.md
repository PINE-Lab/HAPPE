### Welcome to the Manopt GIT repository ###

Manopt is a Matlab toolbox for optimization on manifolds. For a description of the project, documentation, examples and more, see:

[http://www.manopt.org](https://www.manopt.org).

There, you can also find links to the Python and Julia versions of Manopt.

### How do I get the latest code? ###

Manopt is released in numbered versions from time to time. For most users, it is easiest to download the latest numbered version from

[https://www.manopt.org/downloads.html](http://www.manopt.org/downloads.html).

Alternatively, you can get the latest version of the code from GitHub directly of course.

Contributions are welcome!

### Where can I learn more about optimization on manifolds? ###

Check out these two books, freely available online:

 * Boumal, [An introduction to optimization on smooth manifolds](http://www.nicolasboumal.net/book), 2020
 * Absil, Mahony and Sepulchre, [Optimization Algorithms on Matrix Manifolds](https://press.princeton.edu/absil), 2008
