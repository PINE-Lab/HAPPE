function FLAG = flag_implicit_skip_nan(i)
% FLAG_IMPLICIT_SKIP_NAN sets and gets default mode for handling NaNs
%	1 skips NaN's (the default mode if no mode is set)
% 	0 NaNs are propagated; input NaN's give NaN's at the output
% 
% FLAG = flag_implicit_skip_nan()
% 	gets current mode
%
% flag_implicit_skip_nan(FLAG)    % sets mode 
%
% prevFLAG = flag_implicit_skip_nan(nextFLAG)
%	gets previous set FLAG and sets FLAG for the future
% flag_implicit_skip_nan(prevFLAG)
%	resets FLAG to previous mode
%
% It is used in: 
%	SUMSKIPNAN, MEDIAN, QUANTILES, TRIMEAN
% and affects many other functions like: 
%	CENTER, KURTOSIS, MAD, MEAN, MOMENT, RMS, SEM, SKEWNESS, 
%	STATISTIC, STD, VAR, ZSCORE etc. 
%
% The mode is stored in the global variable FLAG_implicit_skip_nan
% It is recommended to use flag_implicit_skip_nan(1) as default and
% flag_implicit_skip_nan(0) should be used for exceptional cases only.
% This feature might disappear without further notice, so you should really not
% rely on it.
