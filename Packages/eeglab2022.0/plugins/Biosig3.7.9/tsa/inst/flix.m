function Y=flix(D,x)
% floating point index - interpolates data in case of non-integer indices
%
% Y=flix(D,x)
%   FLIX returns Y=D(x) if x is an integer 
%   otherwise D(x) is interpolated from the neighbors D(ceil(x)) and D(floor(x)) 
% 
% Applications: 
% (1)  discrete Dataseries can be upsampled to higher sampling rate   
% (2)  transformation of non-equidistant samples to equidistant samples
% (3)  [Q]=flix(sort(D),q*(length(D)+1)) calculates the q-quantile of data series D   
%
% FLIX(D,x) is the same as INTERP1(D,X,'linear'); Therefore, FLIX might
% become obsolete in future.
