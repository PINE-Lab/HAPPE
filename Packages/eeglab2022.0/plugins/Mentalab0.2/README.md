# Mentalab-EEGLab-Plugin

Mentalab-EEGLab-Plugin is a MATLAB library that acts as a plugin for [EEGLab](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/index.php). Use it to import Mentalab Explore CSV and BIN files into an EEGLab structure. 

## Installation

Currently, plugin installation is manual. Please follow the [Usage guidleines](#usage).

In the near future we will add the plugin to the EEGLab plugins library so that it can be installed directly from EEGLab.

## <a name="usage"></a> Usage

Clone or download this repository directly from GitHub. Unzip the package and move the folder "mentalab-explore" into the EEGLab plugins folder.

Restart EEGLab and select "Import Mentalab Explore data", under File -> Import Data -> Using EEGLAB functions and plugins.
