The READIE Toolbox is a user-friendly computational solution designed to enhance the reporting and analysis of EEG data quality metrics. Developed with a user-friendly interface, it has been integrated into HAPPE EEG preprocessing pipelines (Gabard-Durnam et al., 2018; Monachino et al., 2022) facilitating the automated estimation of reliability, effect size, and Standard Measurement Error (SME) (Luck et al., 2021)for EEG datasets. This innovative tool simplifies the computational process and aids in interpreting data quality metrics, such as effect size, reliability, and SME, providing insights into the optimal number of trials for detecting significant effects and establishing reliable measures. By offering overall and bootstrapped reliability, effect size across increasing numbers of trials, and SME estimates at the participant level, we aim to expand the current set of toolboxes for EEG data quality metric analysis, providing a toolbox that is intuitive and user-friendly for researchers.
