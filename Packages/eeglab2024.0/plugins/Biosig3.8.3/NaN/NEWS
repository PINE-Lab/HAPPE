2021-11-03: Release of NaN-toolbox 3.6.1

* signrank: update computation of p-value
    according to revised references,
    and validated against R.
* cdfplot: use histo instead of histo_mex


2021-07-26: Release of NaN-toolbox 3.6.0

* corrplot, knnsearch <NEW>


2021-02-15: Release of NaN-toolbox 3.5.3

* kappa: Youden index (YI), and SSE as return value
* roc: add maxYI as output value
* naninsttest: check ttest for NaN handling


2020-10-31: Release of NaN-toolbox 3.5.2

* new functions added
   gini: Gini index
   lmom: L-moments
   betapdf, betacdf, betainv:
	beta distribution functions

* bug fixes:
  bland-altman: fix ylabel
  fix debian bug #964210: test tries to download data
  fix #59335: "'load_fisheriris' fails on Windows"
  fix #59336: "(nan) BIST for `ttest` fails"
    this failed because betainv(...) is not available
    the suggestion of add a dependency on statistics package
    does not work, because of a conflict with statistics
    (it would not handle NaNs in the indended way).
    Therefore, functions for beta* distributions are included.
