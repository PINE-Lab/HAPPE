function [outdata,outstate] = asr_process(data,srate,state,windowlen,lookahead,stepsize,maxdims,maxmem,usegpu)
% Processing function for the Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) method.
% [Data,State] = asr_process(Data,SamplingRate,State,WindowLength,LookAhead,StepSize,MaxDimensions,MaxMemory,UseGPU)
%
% This function is used to clean multi-channel signal using the ASR method. The required inputs are 
% the data matrix, the sampling rate of the data, and the filter state (as initialized by
% asr_calibrate). If the data is used on successive chunks of data, the output state of the previous 
% call to asr_process should be passed in.
%
% In:
%   Data : Chunk of data to process [#channels x #samples]. This is a chunk of data, assumed to be
%          a continuation of the data that was passed in during the last call to asr_process (if
%          any). The data should be *zero-mean* (e.g., high-pass filtered the same way as for
%          asr_calibrate).
%   
%   SamplingRate : sampling rate of the data in Hz (e.g., 250.0)
%
%   State : initial filter state (determined by asr_calibrate or from previous call to asr_process)
%
%   WindowLength : Length of the statistcs window, in seconds (e.g., 0.5). This should not be much
%                  longer than the time scale over which artifacts persist, but the number of samples 
%                  in the window should not be smaller than 1.5x the number of channels. Default: 0.5
%
%   LookAhead : Amount of look-ahead that the algorithm should use. Since the processing is causal,
%               the output signal will be delayed by this amount. This value is in seconds and should
%               be between 0 (no lookahead) and WindowLength/2 (optimal lookahead). The recommended
%               value is WindowLength/2. Default: WindowLength/2
%
%   StepSize : The statistics will be updated every this many samples. The larger this is, the faster 
%              the algorithm will be. The value must not be larger than WindowLength*SamplingRate.
%              The minimum value is 1 (update for every sample) while a good value is 1/3 of a second.
%              Note that an update is always performed also on the first and last sample of the data
%              chunk. Default: 32
%
%   MaxDimensions : Maximum dimensionality of artifacts to remove. Up to this many dimensions (or up 
%                   to this fraction of dimensions) can be removed for a given data segment. If the
%                   algorithm needs to tolerate extreme artifacts a higher value than the default
%                   may be used (the maximum fraction is 1.0). Default 0.66
%
%   MaxMemory : The maximum amount of memory used by the algorithm when processing a long chunk with
%               many channels, in MB. The recommended value is at least 64. To run on the GPU, use
%               the amount of memory available to your GPU here (needs the parallel computing toolbox).
%               default: min(5000,1/2 * free memory in MB). Using smaller amounts of memory leads to
%               longer running times.
%
%   UseGPU : Whether to run on the GPU. This makes sense for offline processing if you have a a card
%            with enough memory and good double-precision performance (e.g., NVIDIA GTX Titan or
%            K20). Note that for this to work you need to have the Parallel Computing toolbox.
%            Default: false
%
% Out:
%   Data : cleaned data chunk (same length as input but delayed by LookAhead samples)
%
%   State : final filter state (can be passed in for subsequent calls)
