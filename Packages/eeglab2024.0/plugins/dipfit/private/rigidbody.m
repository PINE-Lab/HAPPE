function [H] = rigidbody(f);

% RIGIDBODY creates the homogenous spatial transformation matrix
% for a 6 parameter rigid-body transformation 
%
% Use as
%   [H] = rigidbody(f)
%
% The transformation vector f should contain the 
%   x-shift
%   y-shift
%   z-shift
% followed by the
%   pitch (rotation around x-axis)
%   roll  (rotation around y-axis)
%   yaw   (rotation around z-axis)

% reimplemented the rotate function, which contained an error (the error is in the AIR technical reference)
% changed all functions to be dependent on the rotate, translate and scale function
% all functions now behave consistenly, which also means that they are not compleetly backward compatible w.r.t. the order of the rotations

% compute the homogenous transformation matrix for the translation
T = translate(f([1 2 3]));

% compute the homogenous transformation matrix for the rotation
R = rotate(f([4 5 6]));

% compute the homogenous transformation matrix for the combination
H = T*R;
