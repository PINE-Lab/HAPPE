% IMAGESCTC - DEPRECATED. never completed or documented.
% IMAGESCTC - imagesc in true color. Can help plot different
%               colormap on the same window.
%
% Usage: same as imagesctc
%
% Example:
%         figure; 
%         colormap(jet); 
%         subplot(1,2,1); imagesctc(rand(10,10));
%         colormap(gray); 
%         subplot(1,2,2); imagesctc(rand(10,10));
