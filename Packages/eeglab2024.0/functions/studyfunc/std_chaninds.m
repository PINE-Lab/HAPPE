% STD_CHANINDS - look up channel indices in a STUDY
%
% Usage:
%         >> inds = std_chaninds(STUDY,  channames);
%         >> inds = std_chaninds(EEG, channames);
%         >> inds = std_chaninds(chanlocs, channames);
% Inputs:
%         STUDY    - studyset structure containing a changrp substructure.
%         EEG      - EEG structure containing channel location structure
%         chanlocs - channel location structure
%     channames - [cell] channel names
%
% Outputs:
%       inds - [integer array] channel indices
