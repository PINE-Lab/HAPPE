% NEWTIMEFITC - Function to compute inter-trial coherence (phase locking
%                 factor is another name for it) from single trial spectral
%                 estimates.
%
% Usage:
%   >>  itc = newtimefitc(tfvals, itctype);
%
% Inputs:
%   tfvals - [3-D or 4-D array] single-trial spectral estimates
%           [freqs x times x trials] or [channels x freqs x times x trials)
%   itctype  - ['coher'|'phasecoher'|'phasecoher2'] Compute either linear
%              coherence ('coher') or phase coherence ('phasecoher').
%              Originally called 'phase-locking factor' {default: 'phasecoher'}
%
% Outputs:
%   itc - (nfreqs,timesout) matrix of complex inter-trial coherencies.
%         tc is complex -- ITC magnitude is abs(itc); ITC phase in radians
%         is angle(itc), or in deg phase(itc)*180/pi.
