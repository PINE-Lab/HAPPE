% Description:
%   EEGLAB is Matlab software for processing continuous or event-related 
%   EEG or other physiological data. It is designed for use by both novice and 
%   expert Matlab users. In normal use, the EEGLAB graphic interface calls 
%   graphic functions via pop-up function windows. The EEGLAB history mechanism 
%   can save the resulting Matlab calls to disk for later incorporation into 
%   Matlab scripts.  A single data structure ('EEG') containing all dataset 
%   parameters may be accessed and modified directly from the Matlab commandline. 
%   EEGLAB now recognizes "plugins," sets of EEGLAB functions linked to the EEGLAB
%   main menu through an "eegplugin_[name].m" function (Ex. >> help eeplugin_besa.m).
