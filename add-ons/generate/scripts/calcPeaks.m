% calcPeaks() - A helper function for HAPPE's generateERPs script that
%               identifies maxima/minima in user-specified windows (max or 
%               min per window, as indicated by the user).
%
% Usage: 
%   >> peakVals = calcPeaks(windows, subGlobal)
%
% Inputs:
%   windows   - An array containing the data for each user-defined window,
%               with each cell being a window from the subject's data.
%   subGlobal - The global timeseries for the current trial in which to
%               locate the peaks.
%
% Outputs:
%   peakVals  - An array containing all the peaks per window in the dataset.
