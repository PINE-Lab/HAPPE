% determ_chanIDs() - A helper script for setParams.m from HAPPE. Sets the
%                    channels of interest for the run through user input
%                    from the command line. Allows the user to select all
%                    channels, or to choose which subset of channels to
%                    include/exclude.
%
% Usage: 
%   >> [chansAll, chanIDs] = determ_chanIDs()
%
% Inputs:
%
% Outputs:
%   chansAll - String indicating whether the user is using all channels or
%              a subset of channels. If selecting a subset, additionally
%              indicates if the chan_IDs should be included or excluded.
%   chanIDs  - Cell array, with each cell being the name of a channel of
%              interest. The actual contents will vary based on the input
%              parameters and the chans_all selection to best function
%              with HAPPE's current code.
