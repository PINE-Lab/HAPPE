% isReprocessed() - A helper script for HAPPE. Uses user input to
%                   determine whether the data is raw or has already been
%                   processed. Additionally sets a rerun text extension to
%                   aid in proper saving of HAPPE outputs.
%
% Usage: 
%   >> [reprocessing, rerunExt] = isReprocessed()
%
% Inputs:
%
% Outputs:
%   reprocessing - A binary number [0|1] indicating whether or not data is
%                  being reprocessed. 
%   rerunExt     - A string/character array that is added to the end of
%                  file name to distinguish it from potentially existing
%                  files. Is empty if not reprocessing.
